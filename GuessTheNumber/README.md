# Guess The Number Game
A C++ Graphical User Interface application created by using the cross platform WxWidgets GUI Library. 

This game runs on all OS and uses native controls when displaying the window, which means that the game looks slightly different depending on which OS you are playing it on. Regardless, there should be no issue whatsoever.

The game is very simple. The game will generate a random number between two numbers called starting range and end range (Both the numbers are inclusive). The user will be given a limited number of chnaces to guess the random number. The game will also provide hints after every wrong guess to aid the user.
